Airline Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview
This project explores an airline dataset containing information about passengers, flights, airports, and flight statuses. The goal is to gain insights and answer relevant questions through data visualization and statistical analysis.

Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
Passenger details (e.g., age, gender)
Flight information (e.g., departure time, arrival time)
Airport details (e.g., location, IATA code)
Flight statuses (e.g., delayed, on time)

Key Questions
Which airports have the highest passenger traffic?
Visualize passenger counts by airport.
Identify hubs and popular destinations.
What is the distribution of flight delays?
Create histograms or density plots for departure and arrival delays.
Calculate average delay times.
Are there any seasonal patterns in flight bookings?
Explore monthly trends in passenger numbers.
Consider holidays and special events.
How does flight status vary by airline?
Compare on-time performance across airlines.
Highlight any significant differences.
Analysis Steps
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Merge relevant tables (e.g., passenger data, flight data).
Exploratory Data Visualization:
Use scatter plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Explore correlations between features.
Statistical Insights:
Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, etc.).
Perform hypothesis tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA).
Geospatial Analysis:
Plot airport locations on a map.
Visualize flight routes.
